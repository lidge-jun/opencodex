# Usage client attribution

`src/usage/client.ts` defines the closed client-attribution roster and recognizes bounded
request-header signatures without retaining the header values. HTTP request contexts in
`src/server/index/` and the Responses WebSocket handshake carry that observational label through
`src/server/request-log.ts` projection and `src/usage/log.ts` normalization. Older rows without
the field remain absent, while invalid present values become `unknown`. Combo child adoption
cannot replace the inbound label. The label is caller-supplied evidence, not an authorization
decision. `tests/usage/usage-client-attribution.test.ts` covers the normalization boundary.

`src/usage/source-filter.ts` defines app and device filters. A Codex filter includes recognized
Codex clients and legacy Codex-surface rows; it reports the latter as a separate unclassified
count, without assigning a client subtype. A no-key filter means the stored key ID is absent,
including pre-attribution and environment-admitted rows; it does not prove physical origin.
`src/usage/summary.ts` applies filters before aggregation and retains range-aware unclassified
counts. `src/server/management/usage-aggregate-cache.ts` keys retained aggregates by both source
dimensions, and `src/server/management/logs-usage-routes.ts` validates the complete query before
special projections. The device inventory requires a dashboard session and refuses child scope.

`src/server/index/link-management.ts` binds new source-filtered relay reads to the admitted link
key. Source-filtered snapshot bounds cover only matching rows. `src/client/link-management-relay.ts`
requires the Home's matching source echo and refuses filtered HEAD reads, whose empty body cannot
confirm the scope. Requests without these dimensions retain the previous relay behavior and are not
newly scoped by that rule. `src/server/hub-usage.ts` binds a client-filtered data-plane read to its authenticated
key and emits a safe scope echo; `src/remote/hub-usage.ts` projects it without key IDs, and
`src/client/hub-client.ts` rejects a missing or mismatched echo.
