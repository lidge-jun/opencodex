# Test Sandbox Cleanup

The batch runner's per-process home isolation and live-home/service-manager guards remain active
because the preload installs them before the lock boundary. `tests/preload.ts` resolves cleanup
dependencies after home/lock admission and before test cases. Teardown awaits native-main startup
releases and config hardening, followed by the sandbox's registered ACL child reaps before removing
that root. Its synchronous exit fallback leaves an undrained root for ownership-checked stale
recovery instead of blocking child cleanup with removal retries.
`tests/ci-workflows/test-sandbox-cleanup.test.ts` pins that ordering with a delayed reap.

`tests/helpers/test-sandbox-cleanup.ts` exposes case-scoped lifecycle ownership: cancellation
starts listener stops while owned asynchronous work settles, and repeated close/stop calls share
one promise. After teardown starts only the lifecycle's own abort reason is absorbed; any other
error, including a foreign AbortError, still fails its case. Callers settle that lifecycle before
draining producers/reaps and restoring or removing a home. The helper does not replace
fixture-specific cleanup or claim OS ACL coverage for synthetic tests.

`tests/helpers/fixture-teardown.ts` owns management-auth, OAuth live-update, and Anthropic instance
root removal (`tests/helpers/anthropic-instance-fixture.ts`).
It settles producers, then each root's config flights, closes the request-history SQLite index,
drains each root's ACL work, and only then removes drained roots. A producer or history failure
blocks every removal; a root-specific drain failure preserves that root while other drained roots
can be removed. Removal failures do not stop later roots. Environment restoration runs in finally,
and the first failure is rethrown. Undrained roots remain for run-level sandbox cleanup.
`tests/ci-workflows/fixture-teardown-helper.test.ts` verifies ordering and failure gating with injected owners.
