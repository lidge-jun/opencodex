/**
 * Generic OAuth multi-account 429 failover (#2568).
 *
 * The API-key twin (`providers/key-failover.ts`) rotates by default for any key provider with a
 * 2+ pool, but it returns false for `authMode === "oauth"`, and the only OAuth rotator that
 * exists is Anthropic's — behind its own opt-in. So xAI, Cursor, Kimi, GitHub Copilot,
 * Antigravity and Nous have no recovery path on a 429 even with several accounts logged in.
 *
 * Deliberately narrower than the Anthropic pool: no session affinity, no quota-ranked selection,
 * no probe leases. Those carry provider-specific meaning; this module only answers "the account
 * that just 429'd is cooled, is there another one we may use".
 *
 * NOT a home for Codex (`codex/routing.ts` owns quota scopes and probe leases) or Anthropic
 * (`oauth/anthropic-routing.ts` owns affinity and a fail-closed local-cli credential rule).
 * Both are excluded by `isGenericFailoverProvider`.
